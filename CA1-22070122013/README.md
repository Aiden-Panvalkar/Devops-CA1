# Kaggle Digit Recognizer Project - PRN 22070122013

## Overview
This project solves the **Kaggle Digit Recognizer** problem using **Logistic Regression**.  
It classifies handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.

## Files
- `digit_recognizer.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full implementation.  
- `submission.csv` → Kaggle submission file.  
- `README.md` → Project description.  

## Results
- Achieved **~91.9% validation accuracy**.  

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
2. Run all cells to train and generate predictions.  
3. Submit `submission.csv` to Kaggle.
